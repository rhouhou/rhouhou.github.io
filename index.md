## About
I am an independent researcher working at the intersection of inverse problems, physics-based modeling, and data-efficient scientific inference. My research focuses on developing physically grounded inverse modeling frameworks for complex systems under data scarcity, uncertainty, and ill-posedness, with applications in biophotonics, imaging, and multimodal scientific sensing.
