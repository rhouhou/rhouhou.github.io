- Physics-informed multimodal fusion  
- Trustworthy scientific AI  

## Focus Problems
- Multimodal optical tissue characterization  
- Hyperspectral reconstruction and diagnosis  
- Cross-device generalization in photonic imaging  

## Methods
- self-supervised learning  
- generative modeling  
- Bayesian inference  
- uncertainty quantification  
- physics-guided neural networks
